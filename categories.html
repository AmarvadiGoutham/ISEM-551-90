                <a href="/products.html#roadbike"><h2>Road Byk</h2></a>
                <p>Road bicycle is used to describe bicycles built for traveling at speed on paved roads. Some sources use the term to mean racing bicycle. Other sources specifically exclude racing bicycles from the definition, using the term to mean a bicycle of a similar style but built more for endurance and less the fast bursts of speed desired in a racing bicycle; as such, they usually have more gear combinations and fewer hi-tech racing features. Certain of these bicycles have been referred to as 'sportive' bicycles to distinguish them from racing bicycles.</p>
            <a href="/products.html#touringbike"><h2>Touring Byk</h2></a>
                <p>A touring bicycle is a bicycle designed or modified to handle bicycle touring. To make the bikes sufficiently robust, comfortable and capable of carrying heavy loads, special features may include a long wheelbase (for ride comfort and to avoid pedal-to-luggage conflicts), frame materials that favor flexibility over rigidity (for ride comfort), heavy duty wheels (for load capacity), and multiple mounting points (for luggage racks, fenders, and bottle cages).</p>
            <a href="/products.html#utilitybike"><h2>Utility Byk</h2></a>
                <p>A utility bicycle is a bicycle designed for practical transportation, as opposed to bicycles which are primarily designed for recreation and competition, such as touring bicycles, racing bicycles, and mountain bicycles. The vast majority of bicycles that can be found in the developing world[1] are utility bicycles. As such, utility bicycles are the most common form of bicycle globally.</p>
            <a href="/products.html#mountainbike"><h2>Moutain Byk</h2></a>
                <p>Mountain bikes are typically ridden on mountain trails, fire roads, logging roads, single tracks and other unpaved environments. These types of terrain commonly include rocks, washouts, ruts, loose sand, loose gravel, roots, and steep grades (both inclines and declines). Mountain bikes are built to handle this terrain and the obstacles that are found in it like logs, vertical drop offs, and smaller boulders..</p>
            <a href="/products.html#BMXbike"><h2>BMX Byk</h2></a>
                <p>BMX bikes are designed for stunts, tricks, and racing on dirt BMX tracks. They have a single gear ratio with a freewheel and are built with smaller frames and wheels with wider, treaded tires.</p>
